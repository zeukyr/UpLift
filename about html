If you're a current first-generation university student, you can join a supportive network of peers and exchange academic resources.</p>
        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>We envision a community where first-generation students feel valued, supported, and connected, enabling them to overcome challenges and achieve their educational goals.</p>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Getting involved with UpLift is easy! To be able to participate in discussions, all you have to do is <a href="signup.html" class="button-link">make an account</a>. </p>

        <p> "Wow!! Making an account at Untitled was the smartest choice I have made in my university career. Being the first in my family to go to university was certainly tough, but I'm so glad that I was able to find people who could guide me through every part of the process — from finding scholarships to dealing with bureaucracy to making friends!" </p>
